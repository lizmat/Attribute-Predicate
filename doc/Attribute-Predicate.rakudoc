Attribute::Predicate - add "is predicate" trait to Attributes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Attribute::Predicate;

class Foo {
    has $.bar is predicate;         # adds method "has-bar"
    has $.baz is predicate<bazzy>;  # adds method "bazzy"
}

Foo.new(bar => 42).has-bar;    # True
Foo.new(bar => 42).bazzy;      # False

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds a C<is predicate> trait to C<Attributes>.  It is similar
in function to the "predicate" option of Perl's C<Moo> and C<Moose> object
systems.

If specified without any additional information, it will create a method
with the name "has-{attribute.name}".  If a specific string is specified,
then it will create the method with that given name.

The method in question will return a C<Bool> indicating whether the attribute
has a defined value.
